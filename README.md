# javalings â˜• ðŸ’»  (in development)

--- 

Greetings and welcome to `javalings`.

This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Java code.  
This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!  

In case you have not noticed it yet:  
This project was inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

## Installing javalings (auto)

<details>
  <summary>Windwos</summary>

Open PowerShell (Run as Administrator). Navigate to the location where javalings should be installed.
Then set `ExecutionPolicy` to `RemoteSigned`:

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then, you can run:

```ps1
Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppahansi/javalings/main/install_javalings.ps1 -Destination $env:TMP/install_javalings.ps1; Unblock-File $env:TMP/install_javalings.ps1; Invoke-Expression $env:TMP/install_javalings.ps1
```

This will install the required dependencies and clone the repository in the current folder.  
Once everything is done, navigate inside the `javalings` folder.  

```ps1
cd javalings
```

If you get a permission denied message, you might have to exclude the directory where you cloned javalings in your antivirus.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>MacOs / Linux(Ubuntu) (NOT WORKING YET)</summary>

Navigate to the location where javalings should be installed. Then run:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oppahansi/javalings/main/install_javalings.sh | bash
```

Or if you want to pass in the path instead:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rustlings/main/install_javalings.sh | bash -s mypath/
```

This will install the required dependencies and clone the repository in the current folder.  
Once everything is done, navigate inside the `javalings` folder.

## Installing javalings (manually)

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

### Java

Either use the installer from the oracle:  
[Oracle Installer](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

Or use a package manager:

chocolatey:
```ps1
choco install openjdk --version=17.0.2
```

winget:
```ps1
winget install -e --id ojdkbuild.openjdk.17.jdk
```

### Git

Follow the [official Git installation guides](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Source Code

**Either clone the repository:**  
Windows / MacOS / Linux(Ubuntu), in your preferred shell/console:

SSH
```shell
git clone git@github.com:oppahansi/javalings.git
```
HTTPS
```shell
git clone https://github.com/oppahansi/javalings.git
```

**OR download the source code and extract it.**

**Note:**  
If you choose to download the source code the `reset` command will not work.  
`reset` command needs repository cloning.

### CMD/PowerShell color codes fix for Windows 10

I am using ANSI characters to display colors and special characters.
To correctly display those in CMD or PowerShell you will have to enable   
VirtualTerminalLevel.

Run this in powershell, not sure if admin is needed. Rerun as admin if it fails.

```ps1
Set-ItemProperty HKCU:\Console VirtualTerminalLevel -Type DWORD 1
```
